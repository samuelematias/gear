## Watch // [Breitling Endurance Pro](https://www.breitling.com/us-en/watches/professional/endurance-pro/X82310A41B1/)

Light weight, waterproof, but still dresses up - this is my favorite timepiece that I brought on my bike packing/raft expedition along the southern coast of Iceland. Stood up to some of the toughest conditions I've ever seen.

## Shades // [POC Require - Black](https://na.pocsports.com/products/require?variant=39331364536486)

Super comfortable, light, great protection, and hard to break - these are my daily drivers especially during those bright summer days in California.

## Portable Charger // [Nitecore NB10000 Power Bank](https://www.nitecorestore.com/Nitecore-NB10000-Gen-2-Power-Bank-p/bat-nite-nb10000.htm)

In my line of work - having an extra charge or two on hand for a phone, camera, or GPS device can be the difference between success and failure - so this tiny power bank comes with me all of the time. Carbon Fiber protection, minimal design, lightest weight on the market, and packs a punch!

## Small Everyday Camera // [SONY Rx100 VII](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/compact-cameras/all-vlog-compact-cameras/p/dscrx100m7-b)

Besides my iPhone - this camera comes with me on most of my expeditions, trips with my family, and other outings where I need something that can capture high quality images but doesn't take up too much space in my kit. I've shot everything from the northern lights to crossing glacial rivers while in a kayak on this little camera.

**Profession**

explorer, photographer, creative director, speaker, and author

**One place everyone needs to visit at least once?**

Iceland - I've been over 50 times, couldn't recommend it more.

**Favorite sweet tooth candy?**

Gummy Bears - Haribo, to be specific

**Most memorable photo you have taken?**

Hard to choose - but probably the image of Justin Quintal surfing underneath the northern lights in Iceland, so much work, passion, and memory for me in that photo.

**Best advice for a soon to be father?**

Share a sense of adventure and curiosity with your kids - show them the world and what makes your eyes light up. Doesn't have to be extravagant, sometimes even making an adventure in the backyard is all you can offer - but fostering a sense of wonder from nature and activities is so rewarding as a parent.
