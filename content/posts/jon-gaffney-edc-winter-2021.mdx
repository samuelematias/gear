## Knife // [The James Brand Carter](https://shop.thejamesbrand.com/products/the-carter)

I've been a huge fan of TJB since they launched. They do such a great job of creating a good knife with high performance, that isn't tactical. Their Carter knife is a newer addition to their lineup, but is a favorite of mine. This one is understated with a plain steel blade and micarta scales. I love micarta because it's rugged, but more organic and takes on patina.

## Pen // [Schon Pen (w/clip) in Titanium](https://www.schondsgn.com/collections/ballpoint-pens/products/original-classic-machined-pen)

If I can get it in Titanium, whatever it is, I do. It's lighter, and admittedly just cooler. I've carried one of Schon Dsgn's pens now for a long time. Ian's attention to detail and precision know very few equals. I always have it with the Fisher Space pen ball point insert as for pocket carry I know I can write on whatever I need to.

## Watch // [Tornek-Rayville TR-660](https://tornek-rayville.us/collections/frontpage/products/tr-660-pre-order)

Tool watches are my go-to, and almost exclusively dive watches. Time in, on, and around water is my favorite, and having a watch I can easily go there with is key. The TR-660 is a watch I got to work on the branding and marketing for and a watch I'm incredibly proud of. Normally it would be on a NATO to go over my wetsuits, but I switched it to suede for the holidays.

## Wallet // [Pioneer Carry Molecule Card Case](https://pioneercarry.com/collections/wallets/products/molecule-cardholder)

Pioneer does a great job merging classic wallet designs with cutting edge fabrics. I've been carrying this one frequently for a few years and like the look and feel. I'm strictly a front pocket carry guy so a thin card case wallet is the only way to go.
