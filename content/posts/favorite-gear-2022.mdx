## [Goruck 15L Bullet Ruck Classic](https://www.goruck.com/products/bullet-ruck-15l)

Easily my favorite piece of new to me gear for the year. I was hesitent to invest in another Goruck since I picked up my Rucker 3.0 not to long ago but I really wanted to try the Bullet for more of an everyday carry bag.

After roughly a month of use almost daily, this has become one of my favorite bags I own. For me it is the perfect size for hoping around town. The main reason I wanted the classic vs the new Bullet with laptop compartment was to be able to throw it within my Topo Designs 30L Travel Bag, and use the Bullet when at the travel destination.

## [Tom Bihn Trucker](https://www.tombihn.com/products/the-truck?variant=31671415373887)

My first bit of kit from Tom Bihn and I can see why they have such a cult following. The quality is top notch.

This bag primarily sticks in the car and we use it for our weekly grocery shoping. The trucker is a great size, but I am in the market to pick up another one since we typically get a bit more groceries than what typically fits in the Trucker.

## [Ice Barrel](https://icebarrel.com/product/ice-barrel/)

This year I started practicing cold water therapy. I first started by taking cold showers, then invested in a 100 gallon stock tank which worked great but was difficult to keep cold during the warmer months.

Once I saw the benefits I was getting from the ice baths, I decided to invest in an Ice Barrel.

## [72-Hour Merino Pocket Tee](https://huckberry.com/store/proof/category/p/73772-72-hour-merino-ss-pocket-tee)

Dare I say the perfect tee? I think so. The cut of the shirt fits perfectly for my size, and the benefits of merino wool make for such a solid daily tshirt.

## [Xtratuf 6in Deck Boot](https://huckberry.com/store/xtratuf/category/p/75726-huckberry-x-xtratuf-deck-boot-6)

My Croc's of winter. I where these roughly 90% of the time when leaving the house during the winter months. They keep my feet dry and are easy to take on and off.
